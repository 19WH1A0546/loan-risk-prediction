# loan-risk-prediction
Credit risk predictions, monitoring, model reliability and effective loan processing are key to decision-making and transparency. Banks are making a major part of profits through loans. Though a lot of people are applying for loans, itâ€™s hard to select the genuine applicant, who will repay the loan. Estimating the probability that an individual would default on their loan, is useful for banks to make a decision whether to approve a loan to the individuals or not. The system automatically selects the eligible candidates. The time period for the sanction of loan will be drastically reduced. In our project, we build binary classifiers based on machine learning models in predicting loan risk probability. We find the accuracy for different models in python language and evaluate it to establish the finest model to forecast the finance status for an applicant. 

Our main objective of the project is to develop a risk prediction model based on ML Algorithms for loans rather than conventional methods of loan approval. Given a set of customer detail inputs like customer bank transactional information, the system needs to predict the risk by using various ML Algorithms.
